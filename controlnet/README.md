## Installation
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate control
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmcv-full==1.6.2.3
cd controlnet/annotator/ddp
python setup.py develop
```
## Model Preparation
1. Download the pretrained model from [here](https://huggingface.co/yfji/DDP-Weight/resolve/main/ddp_convnext_t_4x4_512x1024_160k_cityscapes.pth) and put it under `controlnet/annotator/ckpts/ddp_swin_t_2x8_512x512_160k_ade20k`
2. Download the controlnet pretrained model from [here](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/blob/main/models/control_sd15_seg.pth) and put it under `controlnet/models`
3. Launch the gradio server
```
 python gradio_seg2image_ddp.py
```
